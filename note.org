* TODO make form 1040 stub generate wages and withholdings better
do something more sophisticated to generate wages and withholdings so
that withholdings <= wages. as of this writing, this constraint is
ensured by generating wages starting at 1000 and generating
withholdings below 1000

* TODO allow more colors
[2025-01-12 Sun 17:30 -0800]

currently the selected color must be one of the colors in webcolors.names

it would be cool if instead anything that could be used as a color
could be used. for example, #123, or rgb(a,b,c)

** TODO think more about how to handle theme_id
[2025-01-12 Sun 16:05 -0800]
for now, you can only use your own themes
you can delete your own themes

later: make it so you can use someone else's theme

if king deletes a theme, then it becomes a system theme by setting
creator_id to null

if no one is using it, then the record gets deleted

** DONE be more efficient with db

CLOSED: [2025-01-12 Sun]
[2025-01-12 Sun 16:05 -0800]

right now every single test creates all the tables and seeds them from
scratch.

instead, each test could do its actions, then roll them back.

in order to add default theme,

    + run this instead of init_default_theme
* DONE test if dict int keys will be transformed into str
CLOSED: [2025-01-12 Sun]
in ~state_schema.py~,

could this

#+begin_src python
    king: Dict[str, Union[KingPublicSchema, KingPrivateSchema]]
#+end_src

instead be this
#+begin_src python
    king: Dict[int, Union[KingPublicSchema, KingPrivateSchema]]
#+end_src
?
** answer: not high enough priority
would require custom JSON encoder to make use of it.

when routes send out a dict, they implicitly jsonify it. if the dict
has an int for a key, the default json encoder won't convert it
automatically.  this is left as a future upgrade
